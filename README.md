# Nixie Clock

This repo is for a webpage that displays a digital version of a Nixie Tube clock. 

I had the idea of creating an actual Nixie Tube clock using actual hardware and a microcontroller. 

Then I realized that I didn't have the space to work on it.

My goal for creating this clock was to work on my technical skills and create something pleasant to look at.

I decided that, until I have the space for a physical clock project, I should create a digital clock project.

And that's where this begins: the Nixie Clock...
